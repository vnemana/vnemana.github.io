I follow many sports - cricket, football (both regular and American), basketball etc. I tend to follow the sport in general, but I do have my favorites. I root for the Indian cricket team, Arsenal football club and the Golden State Warriors. I "root" for the Chicago Bears, but for the past 20 years, for the most part, I have lost interest in them pretty early in the season. I end up watching the - you know - actual football teams. Most of my blog will be about sports.

I also code for work, and I like it. Sometimes I might post things about coding.

India just got whupped by New Zealand in the T20 world cup. A squad boasting of two all-time great limited overs batsmen, an all-time great bowler and several highly talented, well-prepared cricketers lost two games before the first 6 overs were bowled in both matches.

Are we just bad in tournaments or bad at T20 or bad at facing pressure? I'm guessing it's a combination of factors.

### Jaded team
First, there's the non-stop bio-bubbles. Most of the squad was in a bio bubble in England - the tour started in early July. They then came to the UAE for the second leg of the IPL and probably went straight to the T20 World Cup. That's nearly 6 months of hotel rooms, quarantines, almost daily covid testing, strict curfews, training and matches. There's hardly any time or space to turn yourself off from the game. Shami, Bumrah, Pant, Jadeja, Ashwin, KL Rahul, Rohit, Kohli and the entire coaching staff have been in bubbles since the England tour (I'm including the World Test Championship in the tour). 

Then, there's the overall jaded feeling for the old pros. A few of them have very young kids. Rohit Sharma is 34 years old, and has been playing since the 2007 T20 world cup. Kohli has been playing pretty much non-stop since 2008. Ashwin, Bhuvi, Jadeja and Sharma are old horses too. T20 is a young man's game and there's precious little youth in the team. Obviously, this is in hindsight, but perhaps India would have been better off picking youngsters like Ruturaj Gaikwad, Avesh Patel, Prasidh Krishna and other young IPL performers.

### Power
The power hitters we have are - Rohit, KL, Pant and Hardik. None have fired. Rohit's usual approach of going slow in the initial overs just doesn't work when KL is in the same conservative mould. They can't be paired together, but if separated, Rohit is the better bet to open with Ishan Kishan rather than KL. Rohit at least has the easy six-hitting power that would clear infields in the first 6 overs. All this is moot though. They have all performed very well in the past. Its amazing and rare that they have all failed together.

Then there's power in bowling. Almost every squad in the WC (even Sri Lanka and Bangladesh) boasts of a genuine 150 Kph pacer. India doesn't. The pitches and the conditions just don't work for our 135-140 Kph seamers. This isn't England or Australia. The pitches in the middle east are dead. You need pace through the air to make a difference and we don't have that.

### End of the line
Finally, it is the last tournament for the coaching staff; and the last tournament for Kohli as captain. They have done massive service for Indian cricket. But perhaps they have one eye to the end. Retirement beckons for Shastri and Kohli has never been a dynamic or creative captain. His strengths have been in laying down and executing on processes - something he did to great effect in his personal batting evolution as well as the team's growth, but not something that helps in a high stakes, win-or-go-home set of matches.

I personally loved this iteration of the Indian team (post-Dhoni). They prioritized test cricket, won in Australia and England, played fearless cricket and demonstrated the true depth of Indian cricket's talent to devastating effect. India is a respected squad for its cricketing merits. It feels like an Australian squad in that they are never going to be down for too long. Maybe a more dynamic game manager will captain the side next, but the systems and processes laid down, will hopefully carry over. The professionalism of the Indian structure will ensure we are at or near the top in the future. 

Meanwhile, this tournament is pretty much done and dusted.
